## Developing a holonic shop floor control system using MANPro for agent-to-agent communications

This repository is part of the soon to be released paper named "Developing a holonic shop floor control system using MANPro for agent-to-agent communications".
The code is made public under the MIT license. More information can be found the the repository's ```license``` file.

## Usage

To run the shop floor control system simulation the needed packages need to be installed.
On top of the python 3 standard libraries matplotlib is required.
An exhaustive list of all dependencies can be found in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
To run all four simulation scenarios simply run ```python3 main.py```.
The plot for each scenario will be saved as an image in the same directory as the main.py file.
Metrics like mean time and standard deviation will be printed to standard out.

New test scenarios may be added or present ones may be changed in the ```main.py``` file.
Please refer to the codes documentation for detailed explanations of classes and methods.
